# Linear-Regression-Model

I implemented Linear Regression on the California Housing Dataset to predict Median House Value.

ðŸ“Š Model Insights

Goal: Predict housing prices using numerical and categorical features.

Approach: Fit a Linear Regression model as a baseline.

Evaluation: Compared Actual vs Predicted values.

ðŸ“ˆ Visualization

Below is the scatter plot of predictions:

Blue dots â†’ Actual vs Predicted values

Red dashed line â†’ Perfect prediction line (y = x)

The closer the points are to the red line, the better the model performance.
